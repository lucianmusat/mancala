            This little project started from a job application code challenge that I received. <br />I was given a day to complete
            it, and it wasn't very good upon completion, but I liked working on it, so I decided to continue in my spare time.
            <br />In time I added a few features, and maybe I will add more in the future, depending on how much time I have.
            <br /><br />One of the things I added is multi-session support. In the background it runs a Redis container that keeps track of players sessions.
            <br /><br />Another feature is AI player support, two different types of AI each with its own difficulty setting. The easy AI is a random strategy,
            while the hard AI is a minimax strategy that tries to pick the best move by calculating all the moves 2 levels in the future.
            <br />The hard AI should be pretty good, but beatable.
